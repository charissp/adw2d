<h2>How Does It Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><div class="grow pic"><img src="guest--female-tech.png">Our organizing team looks for the most interesting, atractive, single women we can find. </div></li>
<li>💌 The women get special invitations (like the one you’re looking at now!)</li>
<li>🙅🏻 Female organizers review potential male guests and decide which ones get invited.</li>
<li>🔑 8 men and 8 women show up for a night of food, drink, conversation, and tests of… Ability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why would you do this?</h3>
<p>Because dating in KL is just so… Boring. </p>
<p>You deserve better. And you’re going to get it.</p>


<h3>How do I get in?</h3>
<p>Don’t call us - we’ll call you. </p>
<p>Just respond to the person who showed you this invitation. </p>
